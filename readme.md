A light, super fast, and intuitive static build system made for front end development and building web apps.

Installation
------------

Make sure you have [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed, then just run `npm install roots -g` and you'll be all set.

##### OSX Installs
* If you encounter problems when installing. Please ensure Xcode and Xcode Command Line Tools are Installed.
* From Xcode go to Preferences -> Download -> Command Line Tools -> Install to install command line tools.

##### Windows Installs
* If you encounter problems when installing. Please ensure [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), Python 2.7, and Visual C++ runtime executables are installed.
* You can install Windows Visual C++ components by doing any of the following: Installing Visual Studio 2005 or above, installing the .NET framework or manually adding it to your system PATH if it already exists on your machine.

Usage
-----

Once you have roots installed, you can use the command line to wrangle your project. You must be at least somewhat familiar with the command line to be able to use roots. All the possible commands and options are explained clearly on the [man page](http://roots.cx/docs/man.html).

- [official roots tutorials](http://roots.cx#tutorials) - walkthroughs of roots' major functionality
- [official roots documentation](http://roots.cx/docs) - documentation for major roots features and functionality

Documentation

Version Problems
----------------

Roots v3 does not compile Roots v2 projects and will give an error. To check the version of your project, check the first line in `app.coffee`. Check the version of Roots you're using with `roots -v`. To remove Roots globally, `npm remove -g roots`. To view available versions of Roots, `npm view roots`. To install a specific version of Roots, `npm install -g roots@2.1.3`. Running `npm update -g` will update your version of Roots. You might have to prepend these commands with `sudo` on your system.

Help
----

If you are confused and/or having trouble, one of the solutions below will almost certainly get you back on your feet:

The Future
----------

See the [issues](https://github.com/jenius/roots/issues) for discussion of upcoming features and additions. Roots is very actively developed and is moving forward at a rapid pace. Our goal is to push static sites and "single page apps" as far as they can possibly go, and we're well on the way.
