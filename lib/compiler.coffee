   * Goes through each extension, calls the function with `ctx` as its
   * context, each hook returns a possibly modified instance of the context,
   * and that is passed to the next function as it's context. this way, each
   * function not only has access to the local context, but also has the
   * opportunity to modify it going forward.
   * 
   * Finally, the context is passed out through the deferred handler and
   * flows through to the rest of the compile process.
